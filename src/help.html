LSI viewer (Libre Spatial Information Viewer) was developed for users who may not have access to a suite of GIS software tools but would like to just view/display and print/export the data they have. LSIViewer is an Online Spatial Map Viewer for your Local Data including Map Styling. Currently it can be used as a Map Viewer for Shapefile (.shp) format data. Other data formats are planned to be supported in later versions. <br\>This online tool has been developed using a set of <b>FOSS </b> tools and we thank all FOSS contributors for making this work possible. <br\> <br\> The tool will be released as an Open Soure Project soon. <br\> If inerested, please contact any one of the developers. <br\><br\>
